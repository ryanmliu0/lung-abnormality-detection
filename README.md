# Lung Abnormality Detection
A research project conducted at the Lab of Medical Imaging and Computing at MGB that aims to detect abnormal structures in lung radiographs using various machine learning techniques. 

The research project, undertaken at the Lab of Medical Imaging and Computing(LMIC) at MGB, is dedicated to advancing the field of diagnostic radiology. Focused on lung radiographs, the project employs machine learning techniques to develop a sophisticated automated system for the early detection of abnormal structures within the lungs. By leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms and deep learning models, the researchers aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of identifying anomalies, contributing to early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes in pulmonary health. This innovative initiative at the intersection of medical imaging and artificial intelligence represents a significant stride towards revolutionizing diagnostic processes in respiratory healthcare.
